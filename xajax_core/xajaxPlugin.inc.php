	Request plugins handle the registration, client script generation and processing of
	xajax enabled requests.  Each plugin should have a unique signature for both
	the registration and processing of requests.  During registration, the user will
	specify a type which will allow the plugin to detect and handle it.  During client
	script generation, the plugin will generate a <xajax.request> stub with the
	prescribed call options and request signature.  During request processing, the
	plugin will detect the signature generated previously and process the request
	accordingly.
